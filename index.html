    <h1>*Ingredients*</h1>
<ul>1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
<ul>>1 cup oat flour</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup white sugar</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon baking powder</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
<ul>2 eggs, separated</ul>
<ul>>1 1/2 cups milk</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons canola oil</ul>
<ul>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>

<h1>*Direction*</h1>
 <P>Preheat a waffle maker according to manufacturer's directions.
Whisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk egg yolks, milk, canola oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Beat egg whites in a third bowl (not plastic) with an electric mixer until soft peaks form when you lift the beaters straight out of the beaten eggs, 1 to 2 minutes.
Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the milk mixture into the well; mix batter until smooth. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter, retaining as much volume as possible. Let batter stand until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
Pour 1/2 cup of batter, or amount recommended by the manufacturer, onto the waffle maker; close lid and bake waffle until browned and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes.</P>
